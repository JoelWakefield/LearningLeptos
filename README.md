# Learning Leptos

A repo to keep track of leptos concepts and examples.

## Notes
- [`move`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/keyword.move.html): converts any variables captured by reference or mutable reference to variables captured by value.
- [`signal`](https://docs.rs/leptos/latest/leptos/reactive/signal/fn.signal.html): state management, returns a getter and setter tuple (like [`useState`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState) in React)
